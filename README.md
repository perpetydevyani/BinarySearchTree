# BINARY SEARCH TREE

## DESCRIPTION:
Design a class BSTNode in Java with a member variable info to store an integer and
two references, left and right, to represent its left and right children. Implement a
constructor to initialize these attributes. Develop a method to insert a node while
maintaining the properties of a binary search tree. Extend this implementation by
adding methods for traversing the tree using pre-order, in-order, and post-order
techniques. Finally, add a main method to create a binary search tree, insert multiple
nodes, and invoke the traversal methods to display the tree structure.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Java


## How to Run
1.
     ```bash
     javac BinarySearchTree.java
     java BinarySearchTree
     ```

## Sample Output
```
InOrder: 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 
PreOrder: 50 30 20 40 70 60 80 
PostOrder: 20 40 30 60 80 70 50 

```
